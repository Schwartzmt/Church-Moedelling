* CustomerId: a unique identifier for each customer.
* Surname: surname of the customer.
* CreditScore: credit score of the customer.
* Geography: country of the customer.
* Gender: gender of the customer.
* Age: age of the customer.
* Tenure: number of years for which the customer has been with the bank.
* Balance: balance in the customer's account.
* NumOfProducts: number of bank products the customer is using.
* HasCrCard: indicates whether the customer has a credit card (1) or not (0).

* Exited: indicates whether the customer has exited the bank (1) or not (0).

## Descriptions

[EDA_and_logistic_efficient.ipynb](./EDA_and_logistic_efficient.ipynb) | 
* The code first loads the data into a Pandas dataframe and performs some basic EDA operations such as checking missing values, statistical summary, distribution of target column, and correlation matrix.
* Then it encodes the categorical features and concatenates the encoded features with the original data.
* Finally, it splits the data into training and testing sets and fits a Logistic Regression model on the training data. It then predicts the target on the test data and evaluates the model using the confusion matrix and classification report.


## Steps

* Load the customer churn data into a pandas dataframe
* Perform exploratory data analysis by checking the head of the data, the shape of the data, for missing values, and plotting the distribution of numerical and categorical variables.
* Prepare the data for the model by splitting it into training and test sets, one-hot encoding categorical variables, and fitting a logistic regression model.
* Predict customer churn using the logistic regression model and evaluate its performance using the classification report.
