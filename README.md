# EDA AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION

## Descriptions

[EDA_and_logistic_efficient.ipynb](./EDA_and_logistic_efficient.ipynb) | 
* The code first loads the data into a Pandas dataframe and performs some basic EDA operations such as checking missing values, statistical summary, distribution of target column, and correlation matrix.
* Then it encodes the categorical features and concatenates the encoded features with the original data.
* Finally, it splits the data into training and testing sets and fits a Logistic Regression model on the training data. It then predicts the target on the test data and evaluates the model using the confusion matrix and classification report.
